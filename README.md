# Postfix Expressions Calculator

## Overview

This C++ program implements a calculator for evaluating mathematical expressions written in postfix notation. Postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), eliminates the need for parentheses and operator precedence rules by representing expressions in a straightforward, unambiguous way.

## Background

In traditional infix notation, operators are placed between operands, and parentheses are used to control the order of operations. Postfix notation, however, places operators after their operands, simplifying expression evaluation. This project is inspired by the work of Jan Lukasiewicz, who introduced Polish notation in the 1920s, and Charles L. Hamblin, who proposed Reverse Polish Notation in the 1950s.

## Example Conversions

Infix Expression: `a + b`
Postfix Expression: `ab+`

Infix Expression: `a + b * c`
Postfix Expression: `abc*+`

Infix Expression: `(a + b) * c`
Postfix Expression: `ab+c*`

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/3bda1137/-Postfix-Expressions-Calculator.git
    ```

2. Build the executable:

    ```bash
    cd -Postfix-Expressions-Calculator
    g++ -o calculator main.cpp
    ```

3. Run the calculator with a postfix expression as an argument:

    ```bash
    ./calculator "6 3 + 2 *"
    ```

4. Get the result of the expression.

## Algorithm

The calculator uses a stack-based algorithm to evaluate postfix expressions. It scans the expression from left to right, and when an operator is encountered, it retrieves the required number of operands from the stack, performs the operation, and continues.
